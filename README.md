# Noob-Server-node

I made this to help out people in TN tickets to have a easier way to deploy a bare server

## Setup

To set this up its pretty easy. First deploy this to where ever you would like as long as it allows for HTTP Servers (No Static Hosts)

Once you have that figured out run `npm i` then `npm start` and your good to go!
